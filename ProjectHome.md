# Trait Mining #

The genebank collections worldwide provide the genetic diversity required for plant breeding activities. To access the useful traits the plant breeders most often need to conduct large screening experiments to identify the accessions holding such desired traits. _Focused Identification of Germplasm Strategy_ (**FIGS**) was proposed as a new approach to assist plant breeders and other genebank users looking for a target trait property. The principles of this new approach is based on finding a link between the target trait property and the ecoclimatic profile at the original collecting location for landraces and wild relatives of the cultivated plants. This thesis provides some of the first experimental evidence to support the FIGS concept. Efficient crop improvement programs and effective plant breeding activities are a high priority to ensure future food supply under the challenges of climate change and a rapidly growing world population.

## SUPPORT and COLLABORATION ##

These MATLAB scripts are work under development. You may use the trait mining scripts as they are. There are also some interest to establish this toolbox for R. Any interest to help developing these scripts further are most welcome. You may contact [dag.endresen@gmail.com](http://mailto:dag.endresen@gmail.com).


## Software ##

These MATLAB scripts are based on the [PLS Toolbox](http://www.eigenvector.com/software/pls_toolbox.htm) from [Eigenvector inc.](http://www.eigenvector.com/index.htm)

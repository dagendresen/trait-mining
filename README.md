# Trait mining toolbox

## Introduction
The genebank collections worldwide provide the genetic diversity required for plant breeding activities. 
To access the useful traits the plant breeders most often need to conduct large screening experiments to 
identify the accessions holding such desired traits. Focused Identification of Germplasm Strategy (FIGS) 
was proposed as a new approach to assist plant breeders and other genebank users looking for a target 
trait property. The principles of this new approach is based on finding a link between the target trait 
property and the ecoclimatic profile at the original collecting location for landraces and wild relatives 
of the cultivated plants. This thesis provides some of the first experimental evidence to support the FIGS 
concept. Efficient crop improvement programs and effective plant breeding activities are a high priority 
to ensure future food supply under the challenges of climate change and a rapidly growing world population.

## Software
These MATLAB scripts are based on the PLS Toolbox from Eigenvector inc. Work is in progress to migrate to R.

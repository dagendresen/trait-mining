WHERE DOES THE TOOLBOX WORK?
The toolbox has been tested with PLS Toolbox 6.0 (R6.0.1) on MATLAB 7.8 (R2009a) on a Mac OS X, version 10.6.7. Previous version of the scripts have also been verified to work fine with MATLAB and PLS Toolbox on a virtual installation of Windows XP (using Parallels Desktop).


SETTING UP THE TOOLBOX
In order to install the toolbox, simply (extract and) copy the files to a directory (e.g. trait_mining). 

Make sure that the path ../trait_mining is included in MATLAB's path. If you have other toolbox with some files are named identically, this could cause problems depending on which functions you use. If you want to use e.g. the dso_info function from the Trait-mining toolbox, you have to ensure that either the path to the Trait-mining toolbox appears before the path to other toolbox with such function name or that you run Matlab from the trait_mining directory.

In order to get help on one of the functions in the toolbox type <<help [function name]>> at the Matlab command line (if trait_mining is the name of the directory where you have the files.
